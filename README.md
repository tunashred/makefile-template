# Makefile template
First designed to build my hashtable library but the idea was scrapped because seemed a lot of overhead for that project. I got left with a full fancy makefile so I decided to make a new repository for it's glory.

# What can it do?
It takes the files from ```./src``` and ```./include``` directories and outputs the executable, ```.o``` and ```.c``` files in the ```./build``` directory.
