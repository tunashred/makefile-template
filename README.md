# Makefile template
First designed to build my hashtable library but the idea was scrapped because seemed a lot of overhead for that project. I got left with a full fancy makefile so I decided to make a new repository for it's glory.

# Motivation
It's just cool to have a makefile template which can be quickly modified so as I can build projects.

# What can it do?
This makefile can be run in two ways:
1. ```make``` builds the project and creates a build directory where it outputs the executable, ```.o``` and ```.d``` files.
2. ```make clean``` removes the build directory and it's contents.
